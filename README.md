# ML

For some reason, I always that ML was some dialect of Lisp. Then I learned it
was a precursor to Haskell.

I don't like ML. The name lacks charisma. It sounds like an acronym for
"Machine Language" (which it isn't) or "Machine learning" (which it probably
sucks for) or "Macro Language" (which I really hope it isn't).

Well I've now gone and educated myself (with 2 minutes of Wikipedia reading).
OCaml, a language for which I have the greatest respect (because of its desert
dwelling namesake), is a dialect of ML. As is, of course, Standard ML. ML is
a descendent of Lisp, but differs enough to not be a dialect. It adds types.
However, unlike my darling Haskell, ML is a totally impure skank. But to its
credit, it is not lazy.

Wikipedia says it is used in bioinformatics, which I doubt.
